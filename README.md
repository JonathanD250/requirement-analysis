# requirement-analysis

This repository is dedicated to documenting and practising requirement analysis in software development.
It contains resources, exercises, and examples that help understand how to gather, analyse, and manage requirements effectively in real-world projects.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of understanding, gathering, and documenting what a software system should do. It is the foundation of the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

It involves working with stakeholders, end-users, and developers to clearly define functional requirements (what the system should do) and non-functional requirements (how the system should perform).

The importance of Requirement Analysis includes:
- Preventing misunderstandings between developers and clients.
- Reducing the risk of building the wrong product.
- Saving time and cost by identifying issues early.
- Providing a clear roadmap for design, development, and testing.

  Without proper requirement analysis, the software may fail to meet user needs or require costly changes later in the project.
  
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a crucial step in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) because it ensures the project is built on a solid foundation. Its importance can be seen in the following areas:
1. **Clarity and Understanding**
   It creates a shared understanding between stakeholders and developers. Everyone agrees on what needs to be built, which reduces miscommunication.
2. **Cost and Time Efficiency**
   Identifying and fixing problems during the analysis phase is cheaper and faster compared to fixing them later during development or testing.
3. **Quality Assurance**
   Well-defined requirements provide a benchmark for testing. The development team knows exactly what to deliver, which increases the chances of producing a high-quality product.
4. **Project Success**
   Projects that start with clear requirements are more likely to meet user needs and business goals, increasing the overall success rate.
